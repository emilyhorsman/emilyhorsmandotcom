<h1>Emily Horsman</h1>
<p>
  Hello!
  I’m a software engineer during the day and a bike mechanic in my free time.
  I volunteer at <a href="https://www.scenicroutessf.com" target="_blank">Scenic Routes Community Bicycle Center</a> and sometimes write things <a href="https://www.scenicroutessf.com/blog" target="_blank">on its blog</a>.
  The best place to see what I’m up to is my <a href="https://bikes.emilyhorsman.com" target="_blank">bike blog</a> — it mostly chronicles the maintenance of my bikes but also includes lots of photos from my rides and life.
</p>
<p>The best way to reach me is via email at <a href="mailto:me+frominterwebs@emilyhorsman.com">me+frominterwebs@emilyhorsman.com</a>.
